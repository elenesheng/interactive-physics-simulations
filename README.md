# 2D and 3D Programming Practice Environment

This repository contains a practice environment for both 2D and 3D programming using p5.js and three.js.

## Project Structure

- `/p5` - Contains the p5.js project for 2D programming
- `/three` - Contains the three.js project for 3D programming

## Setup

Make sure you have Node.js installed, then:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Running the Projects

### p5.js (2D)

To start the p5.js project:

```bash
npm run start:p5
```

This will open a browser window at `http://localhost:3000` with the p5.js sketch.

### three.js (3D)

To start the three.js project:

```bash
npm run start:three
```

This will open a browser window at `http://localhost:3001` with the three.js scene.

## Acknowledgments

Many of the physics simulations in this project, especially those using p5.js, are inspired by Daniel Shiffman's work in ["The Nature of Code"](https://natureofcode.com/) and his [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel. His educational materials have been invaluable in creating these interactive demonstrations.
